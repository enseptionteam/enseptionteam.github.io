title: Core Fundamental Research on AI Technologies for Human Vision Augmentation (Jan. 2026 – Dec. 2030)

abstract: |-
  This project aims to secure world-leading core AI technologies for human vision augmentation by enabling the brain to intuitively understand external visual stimuli that are difficult to perceive due to human physical limitations (vision substitution), and by autonomously adjusting impaired vision in accordance with the user’s visual intent (vision enhancement).
  
  The vision substitution component focuses on developing multimodal vision substitution algorithms that abstract visual information imperceptible due to visual impairment using AI, and deliver it through multiple alternative brain–sensory pathways to compensate for damaged vision.
  
  The vision enhancement component analyzes multimodal biosignals to infer the user’s visual intent and naturally adjusts visual acuity according to that intent using high-speed variable-focus lenses.
