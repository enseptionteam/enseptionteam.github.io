abstract: This study presents a novel approach to improving musical haptic wearables
  by applying deep learning models for music source separation and pitch estimation.
  The system consists of a haptic vest and a pair of haptic gloves, designed to spatially
  convey musical elements throughout the body. By isolating instruments from an audio
  file and recognizing their pitches, our system provides intuitive haptic feedback
  that discretely represents each instrument’s performance. Specifically, we map the
  piano to the gloves, the bass to the back of the vest, and the drums to the front
  of the vest. Then, we conducted a comparative study with a conventional audio-to-haptic
  method. The results showed that users experienced improved clarity, intuitiveness,
  and comprehension, indicating enhanced understanding of musical structure.
