abstract: 'We present a virtual reality (VR) training system that supports safe mobility
  skill development for low-vision users through visual-to-auditory sensory substitution.
  The system combines the vOICe algorithm with walk-in-place locomotion to enable
  navigation in immersive environments while minimizing physical risks and spatial
  requirements. Training with the system follows a two-phase structure: an initial
  learning phase to build familiarity with visual-to-audio substitution, followed
  by a navigation phase in which users apply auditory cues to explore and reach destinations
  in VR. The system provides a safe, controlled environment for developing non-visual
  spatial awareness and serves as an early exploration of a platform for evaluating
  sensory substitution techniques. Through this work, we aim to contribute to solutions
  that promote greater independence in mobility for visually impaired users.'
