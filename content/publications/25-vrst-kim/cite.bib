 abstract = {We present a virtual reality (VR) training system that supports safe mobility skill development for low-vision users through visual-to-auditory sensory substitution. The system combines the vOICe algorithm with walk-in-place locomotion to enable navigation in immersive environments while minimizing physical risks and spatial requirements. Training with the system follows a two-phase structure: an initial learning phase to build familiarity with visual-to-audio substitution, followed by a navigation phase in which users apply auditory cues to explore and reach destinations in VR. The system provides a safe, controlled environment for developing non-visual spatial awareness and serves as an early exploration of a platform for evaluating sensory substitution techniques. Through this work, we aim to contribute to solutions that promote greater independence in mobility for visually impaired users.},
