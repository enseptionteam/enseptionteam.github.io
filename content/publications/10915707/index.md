abstract: The visual sensory organ (VSO) serves as the primary channel for transmitting
  external information to the brain; therefore, damage to the VSO can severely limit
  daily activities. Visual-to-Auditory Sensory Substitution (V2A-SS), an innovative
  approach to restoring vision, offers a promising solution by leveraging neuroplasticity
  to convey visual information via auditory channels. Advances in information technology
  and artificial intelligence mitigate technical challenges such as low resolution
  and limited bandwidth, thereby enabling broader applicability of V2A-SS. Despite
  these advances, integrating V2A-SS effectively into everyday life necessitates extensive
  training and adaptation. Therefore, alongside addressing technical challenges, investigating
  effective learning strategies to accelerate the acceptance of V2A-SS is crucial.
  This study introduces a V2A-SS learning model based on the Information Processing
  Learning Theory (IPLT), encompassing the stages of “concept acquisition, rehearsal,
  assessment” to reduce the learning curve and enhance adaptation. The experimental
  results show that the proposed learning model improves recognition rates, achieving
  an 11% increase over simple random repetition learning. This improvement is significantly
  higher than the gain of 2.72% achieved by optimizing the V2A-SS algorithm with Mel-Scaled
  Frequency Mapping. This study suggests that a structured learning model for sensory
  substitution technologies can contribute to bridging gaps between technical feasibility
  and practical application. This underscores the need to develop effective learning
  models, alongside technological advancements, to accelerate the adoption of V2A-SS
  and neuroplasticity.
