abstract: Recent studies have revealed that visual-auditory sensory substitution devices
  (SSDs) can effectively convey visual information to visually impaired or blind individuals
  through sound. However, SSDs are still not widely available to the visually impaired
  and blind community. Addressing these challenges requires not only the development
  of efficient SSD algorithms but also the evaluation of the impact of SSDs on the
  devices and environments in which they are used. This study represents the first
  attempt to analyze the impact of the device or environment used for SSDs on users’
  perceptual abilities. To achieve this goal, we developed an experimental procedure
  that involves both the training of the SSD algorithm and the changing environment
  and devices that receive the audio signal. Two user experiments were conducted and
  revealed that user perception is significantly affected by the device and environment
  used for SSDs. These findings underscore the importance of considering the effect
  of the device and environment in which it will be used when designing an SSD algorithm
  or training system.
