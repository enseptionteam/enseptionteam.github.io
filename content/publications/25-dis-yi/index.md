abstract: Music can play an important role in the lives of some Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing
  (DHH) individuals, facilitating emotional expression, storytelling, and social interaction
  despite differences in hearing ability and identity. While prior human-computer
  interaction (HCI) research has introduced various functional advancements to enhance
  their music experiences, a deeper exploration of broader user experiences and inclusive
  design strategies remains necessary. To address the real-life challenges DHH individuals
  face in everyday music activities, we conducted focus group interviews in South
  Korea with 39 DHH individuals and 9 music experts. Our analysis identified six dimensions
  of everyday music activities organized by engagement type and social level, highlighting
  the distinct challenges and preferences DHH individuals encounter in musical contexts.
  Based on these insights, we propose design implications for fostering more inclusive
  music experiences, extending beyond individual engagement to include community and
  mixed-group interactions. This work provides a comprehensive framework to inform
  future HCI research and guide the development of inclusive technologies that better
  support DHH individuals’ diverse musical experiences.
