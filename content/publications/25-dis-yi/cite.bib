 abstract = {Music can play an important role in the lives of some Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals, facilitating emotional expression, storytelling, and social interaction despite differences in hearing ability and identity. While prior human-computer interaction (HCI) research has introduced various functional advancements to enhance their music experiences, a deeper exploration of broader user experiences and inclusive design strategies remains necessary. To address the real-life challenges DHH individuals face in everyday music activities, we conducted focus group interviews in South Korea with 39 DHH individuals and 9 music experts. Our analysis identified six dimensions of everyday music activities organized by engagement type and social level, highlighting the distinct challenges and preferences DHH individuals encounter in musical contexts. Based on these insights, we propose design implications for fostering more inclusive music experiences, extending beyond individual engagement to include community and mixed-group interactions. This work provides a comprehensive framework to inform future HCI research and guide the development of inclusive technologies that better support DHH individuals’ diverse musical experiences.},
