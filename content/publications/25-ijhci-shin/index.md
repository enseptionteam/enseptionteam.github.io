abstract: ' The perception of pitch and engagement in melodic singing significantly
  contribute to the appreciation and comprehension of music. Notably, for hard-of-hearing
  individuals, perceiving pitch and singing play crucial roles as effective aids in
  auditory rehabilitation. However, the limited perception of pitch, stemming from
  the constraints of hearing devices, poses challenges in the learning process of
  recognizing and vocalizing melodies. In this study, we developed a wearable vibrotactile
  glove, TTS+, designed to convert musical tones into the corresponding vibrotactile
  patterns, complemented by an associated training application. After ten training
  sessions with our system, the participants exhibited notable improvements in pitch
  perception and the capacity to reproduce melodies through singing compared with
  their pre-test baseline without vibrotactile feedback. Beyond quantitative outcomes,
  findings from user experiences obtained through user feedback during training and
  post-test interviews offer valuable perspectives and constraints for our study,
  which may be further investigated in future studies. '
